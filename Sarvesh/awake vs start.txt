Awake vs Start — short

Awake

Called when the script instance is loaded (scene load or Instantiate).
Runs before any Start methods.
Runs even if the component is disabled.
Use for internal setup and GetComponent assignments.
Start

Called just before the first Update, only if the component is enabled.
Runs after all Awake calls (so other objects have finished their Awake).
Use for initialization that depends on other objects being initialized.
Order (simplified): Awake (all) → OnEnable → Start (all) → Update/FixedUpdate...

Example:
// Example usage
public class Example : MonoBehaviour {
    private Rigidbody2D rb;
    private Transform player;

    void Awake() {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>(); // internal refs
    }

    void Start() {
        player = GameObject.FindWithTag("Player").transform; // safe to rely on other objects
    }
}
